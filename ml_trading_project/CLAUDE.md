## Response Workflow

Before writing code or making suggestions, follow this process:

1. Stop
2. What did the user specifically ask for?
3. Does my approach fit what they asked, or am I defaulting to patterns?
4. If defaulting to patterns, stop and reconsider

## Rules

- Only add features/functions that have been expressly requested
- Do not add things because they seem "standard" or "correct" in other contexts
- If suggesting something new, ask first - don't just implement it
- Each agent has ONE task - don't add functionality that belongs to other agents
